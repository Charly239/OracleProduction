# OracleProduction
For this Project I'm developing a program to assist OracleProduction Ltd in producing a
Production line manufacturing plant.

This Project is a console based application that allows a user to create a product either Audioplayer or movie player, add it to the list, and display all product produced.

# How it works
1)When the application has been succefully started the user will be prompted with a menu to select an option you must enter the corresponding number.
If "1" is entered:
-The user will go through the process of creating a product and then add the product to a list

If "2" is entered:
-The console will print out the total number of products the user created.

If "3" is entered:
-The console will print out all the products including the information of the product.

If any other number is selected:
-The user exits the program
