# OracleProduction
For this Project I'm developing a program to assist OracleProduction Ltd in producing a
Production line manufacturing plant.

This design is a template in java for creating and recording all production line item
but, for this particular production facility I only worked with Audio and Media  Players.
The program will still be flexible enough to be used in any production line, this structure
allows for easy modifications to handle differnet products.
